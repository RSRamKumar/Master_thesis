### Title: Landscaping of COVID-19 Data for the Discovery of Insightful Patterns on Ethnicities – An Attempt
### Period: April - October 2021

Abstract:

COVID-19 disease became a global disaster in the 21st century. This
disease is influenced by several parameters including the extent of the
curfew as it is contagious. Fortunately, the scientific community across
the globe collaborated to facilitate COVID-19 research. To unravel the
ethnicity specific disease characteristics, certain SNPs found in the
population might be a potential cause for the infectivity, drug response
etc. The SNPs found in a population can be linked to molecular pathways
and the outcome of the trial. We collected the SNP data for distinct
populations from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Then, we integrated
the SNP data into the COVID-19 Knowledge graph – Pharmacome.
Eventually, this resulted in the creation of four ethnicity specific
Pharmacomes namely Europe, Asia, Africa, North America and South
America with 1798 SNPs and 239 genes. Chromosome 3 was associated
with the largest number of COVID genes. Certain prominent genes like
OAS, ACE2, DPP9 and TYK2 were identified in the results. Secondly, we
performed the pathway analysis of COVID-19 genes that have a COVID-19
association score of 1.0. This revealed certain key pathways such as spike
protein maturation, interferon signaling, interleukin signaling. The
Pharmacome was further explored to reveal new drug targets for drug
repurposing experiments and revealed many new drugs along with some
already available drugs for the treatment. Adding to the sex bias of the
disease, in an attempt for a genetics-based drug target mechanism
network we identified the top molecular pathways enriched with the gene
MECP2.
